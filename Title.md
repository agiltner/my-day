#My Day#

Today was a fairly quiet day for a _Sunday_.

I was tasked with helping a friend out by fixing something at their restaurant. To do this I had to wake up by 8:00 am to arrive at the restaurant by 9:00 am. The reason for this is that the work I needed to do required the use of noisy power tools and I had to get in before the bar staff showed up to prep. 

After completing the restaurant project I had breakfast at P's and Q's market with friends. After this I spent the rest of the day watching movies and doing some coding homework. All in all, not a bad way to spend a Sunday.
